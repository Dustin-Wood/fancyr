Description: This package includes a range of functions that are valuable 
    for correlational analyses, including:
    - Creating matrices in which reliability over the measurement interval (t) is adjusted
    - Creating 'scale-centered' correlations (see Cohen, 1969)
    - Creating clusters of highly correlating synonyms and antonyms (together)
    - Some useful indices for data screening (e.g., percentage missing values; response variability
    - useful data transformations (e.g., proportion, POMP, and 'standard scale-center-deviation scores')
